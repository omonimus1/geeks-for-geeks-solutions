## How to contribute?
1. Fork the repository
2. Do the desired changes (add/delete/modify)
3. Make a pull request

## When to contribute?
1. If there is no solution to a problem in the main branch.
2. If your solution is asymptotically faster than the one in the main branch.
3. If your algorithm is of the same time complexity but with reduced code size. In this case, comment out the original solution and make a pull request with your solution.
4. If you have another method of solving the problem which is asymptotically slower than the original method then, comment your solution in the main file and make a pull request.
